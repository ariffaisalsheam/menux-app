scalability, maintainability, and efficient performance.
• Frontend: The client-side interface is implemented using React, a widely
adopted JavaScript library known for building responsive and dynamic user
interfaces with reusable components.• Backend: The server-side application is developed using Java Spring Boot, a
powerful framework that facilitates rapid development of RESTful web services
with comprehensive support for dependency injection, security, and integration.
• Database: PostgreSQL is employed as the relational database management
system, chosen for its reliability, strong data integrity features, and ability to
handle complex queries efficiently.
